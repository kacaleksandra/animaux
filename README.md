# What's going on here?

We're just a group of three students from Poland whose goal is to learn vue.js framework from the very beginning. What's even more interesting, most of us don't even know JavaScript basics! Despite that we believe that we are able to create something nice! We are going to create a website about dogs and cats breeding.

Our first challenge was to learn basics of GitHub. Of course we've succeeded and we're very proud of ourselves. We've also agreed on the catalog structure of the project. What's more we added a simple footer file as the beginning of our website.

Henlo, so basically since our last pupdate we managed to make the backbone of our site! We also did some styling to our footer and about us page!
